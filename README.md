# youtube-post
The code you provided appears to be a Python script for uploading Instagram reels to YouTube using the simple-youtube-api library. Here's a breakdown of the different parts of the code:

## Importing necessary modules:
```
import os
import random
import datetime
from simple_youtube_api.Channel import Channel
from simple_youtube_api.LocalVideo import LocalVideo
import sys
```

This block imports the required modules for the program, including os for file operations, random for selecting a random file, datetime for working with dates and times, Channel and LocalVideo classes from simple-youtube-api for YouTube operations, and sys for system-related functionalities.

## Authenticating and initializing the YouTube channel:
```
channel = Channel()
channel.login("client-secret.json", "credentials.storage")
```
Here, the Channel object is created, and the login method is used to authenticate the YouTube channel using the provided client secret file and credentials storage file.

## Defining the media directory:
```
path = 'instaloader/test'
```
The path variable specifies the directory where the Instagram reels media files are
located.

File handling functions:
python
```
def filehandler():
    mp4_files = [f for f in os.listdir(path) if f.endswith(".mp4")]
    random_file = random.choice(mp4_files)
    return random_file

def captionfile(name:str):
    with open(os.path.join(path, name), encoding="utf-8") as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    return lines

def delete(filename):
    text_file = filename + ".txt"
    mp4 = filename + ".mp4"
    os.remove(os.path.join(path, text_file))
    os.remove(os.path.join(path, mp4))
    
```
 
These functions are responsible for handling files. filehandler() selects a random `.mp4` file from the media directory. captionfile(name) reads the lines of a caption file (assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding) specified by the name argument. delete(filename) deletes the caption file and the corresponding "`.mp4`" file.

## Uploading video function:
```

def uploadvideo(mp4_file:str, title:str, description:str, thumbnail:str, tags):
    video = LocalVideo(os.path.join(path, mp4_file))

    # setting snippet
    video.set_title(title)
    video.set_description(description)
    video.set_tags(tags)
    #video.set_category("movie")
    video.set_default_language("en-US")

    # setting status
    video.set_embeddable(True)
    video.set_license("creativeCommon")
    video.set_privacy_status("public")
    video.set_public_stats_viewable(True)

    # setting thumbnail
    video.set_thumbnail_path(os.path.join(path, thumbnail))

    # uploading video and printing the results
    video = channel.upload_video(video)
    print(video.id)
    print(video)

    # liking video
    video.like()
 ```   
The uploadvideo() function takes the arguments necessary for uploading a video to YouTube. It creates a LocalVideo object using the provided ".mp4" file path. The function sets various attributes of the video, such as title, description, tags, language, privacy status, and thumbnail path. Finally, it uploads the video to YouTube using the channel.upload_video() method, prints the video ID and details, and likes the video.

## Retrieving file information and preparing for upload:
python

```
file = filehandler()
filename = file.split(".")
mp4_file = str(filename[0])+".mp4"
text_file = str(filename[0])+".txt"
thumbnail = str(filename[0])+".jpg"

print("uploading : ", mp4_file, text_file, thumbnail)

try:
    caption = captionfile(text_file)
except FileNotFoundError:
    caption = "Sample" #give fail save caption 

title = caption[0]
description = ' '.join([item.replace('\n', '') for item in caption])
tags = [item.replace('#', '').replace('\n', '') for item in [i for i in caption if i.startswith('#')]]
```
In this section, the script selects a random file using filehandler(), splits the filename into its components, and prepares the necessary file paths for upload. The caption file is read using captionfile() or a default "Sample" caption is used if the file is not found. The title, description, and tags are extracted from the caption file content, with appropriate formatting and character replacements.

## Calling the upload function:

```
uploadvideo(mp4_file, title, description, thumbnail, tags)
```
This line calls the `uploadvideo()` function with the necessary arguments to upload the video to YouTube.

Please note that this code assumes the availability of the simple-youtube-api library and the required client secret and credentials storage files. Additionally, make sure to customize the path variable with the correct media directory path for your setup.
